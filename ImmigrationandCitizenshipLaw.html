            Immigration law governs the entry, residence, and status of non-citizens in a country. It includes the regulations and procedures for obtaining visas, residency permits, and citizenship. Immigration law ensures that the movement of people across borders is regulated, aiming to balance national security, economic needs, and humanitarian considerations.

            Citizenship law outlines the requirements and processes by which individuals can acquire, lose, or renounce citizenship. It defines who is a citizen of a country and grants certain rights and responsibilities to citizens. Citizenship law is crucial for determining a person's legal status, political rights, and identity within a nation.</p>
