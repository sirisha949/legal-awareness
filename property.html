            <b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 1: Identify the Issue:</b>Clearly define the nature of the property dispute or transaction. Determine whether it involves ownership disputes, boundary disagreements, contract breaches, zoning violations, or any other legal matter related to real estate.

            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 2:  Seek Legal Consultation:</b>Engage with property lawyers, real estate attorneys, or legal experts specializing in property and land laws. Schedule consultations to discuss your situation, rights, and legal options.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 3:  Title Searches and Due Diligence:</b>Conduct thorough title searches, property inspections, surveys, and due diligence to verify ownership, encumbrances, liens, easements, restrictions, and the legal status of the real property in question. This step is crucial before entering into any transaction or attempting to resolve disputes.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 4:  Gather Documentation:</b>Compile all relevant documentation, including contracts, agreements, deeds, property records, correspondence, and any other evidence that supports your position or clarifies the legal status of the property.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 5:  Evaluate Legal Options:</b>Based on the consultation and findings from the title searches and due diligence, assess the legal options available to you. Determine whether litigation is necessary or if alternative dispute resolution methods can be pursued.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 6:  Filing Lawsuits or Legal Actions:</b>If litigation is deemed necessary, work with your legal representation to file lawsuits, claims, or legal actions in civil courts or relevant judicial forums. Present evidence, documentation, contracts, agreements, and supporting materials to support your case for resolution or adjudication.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 7:  Engage in Alternative Dispute Resolution:</b>Consider employing alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation, arbitration, or settlement negotiations. These approaches can help facilitate communication, negotiation, and compromise between parties, leading to mutually acceptable agreements and avoiding protracted litigation.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 8:  Negotiate Settlements:</b>Engage in settlement negotiations with the opposing party or parties, either directly or through legal representation. Work towards reaching a fair and mutually beneficial agreement that resolves the property-related dispute or conflict.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 9:  Document Resolutions:</b>Once a resolution is reached, ensure that all agreements, settlements, or court orders are properly documented and legally binding. This helps prevent future misunderstandings or disputes regarding the terms of the resolution.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 10: Compliance and Implementation:</b>Ensure compliance with any legal obligations or requirements outlined in the resolution. Implement any necessary actions or changes to resolve the dispute and maintain legal compliance with property laws and regulations.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;"></b>By following these steps and leveraging legal consultation and expertise, parties can effectively navigate property disputes or transactions while protecting their rights and interests within the bounds of property and land laws.
