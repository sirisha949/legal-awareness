        <p><b>Human Rights:</b>

            Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that belong to every person in the world, from birth until death. They apply regardless of where you are from, what you believe, or how you choose to live your life. These rights can never be taken away, although they can sometimes be restricted â€“ for example, if a person breaks the law, or in the interests of national security.
            
            <br><br><b>Importance:</b>
            
            Human rights are important because they are a recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. They are the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world.</p>
