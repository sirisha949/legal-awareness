        <p><b>Environmental Law:</b>

            Imagine the Earth is like a garden that we all live in. Environmental Law is like a set of rules that help us take care of this garden, making sure it's clean, healthy, and beautiful for everyone. These laws protect the environment from pollution, conserve natural resources, and ensure that we use our planet's resources in a sustainable way. Just like taking care of a garden, Environmental Laws help us protect nature and ensure that future generations can enjoy it too.</p>
