        <p><b>Fundamental Rights:</b>

            Imagine you have a special shield that protects you and gives you special powers. That shield is like your fundamental rights. These are special freedoms and protections given to every person in India by the Constitution. They are super important because they help you grow as a person, make choices about your life, and ensure fairness and equality in society. Just like your shield keeps you safe, fundamental rights keep you safe from unfair treatment and help you live a good life.
            
            <br><br><b>Fundamental Duties:</b>
            
            Now, think about being a superhero with responsibilities. Just like superheroes have duties to help people and fight villains, citizens have duties towards their country and society. These are like moral responsibilities that everyone should follow. It's about doing things that help make India a better place, like being honest, respecting others, following the rules, and working hard. These duties might not be written down like rights, but they are important for making our country strong and happy for everyone.</p>
