            <b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 1: Recognizing the Crime:</b> The first step is recognizing that a crime has occurred. This could involve being a victim yourself, witnessing a crime, or even just suspecting criminal activity.
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 2: Reporting to Authorities:</b> Once the crime is recognized, it's important to report it to the appropriate authorities. This usually means contacting law enforcement agencies such as the police or relevant regulatory bodies.

            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 3: Providing Information and Evidence:</b>When reporting the crime, provide as much relevant information and evidence as possible. This might include details of the incident, descriptions of the individuals involved, any physical evidence, and so on.

            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 4: Cooperating with Investigations:</b>After reporting the crime, it's essential to cooperate fully with any investigations that follow. This might involve giving further statements, providing additional evidence, or answering questions from law enforcement officers.<br>
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 5: Participating in Legal Proceedings:</b> If the case goes to court, participation in legal proceedings is crucial. This might involve appearing as a witness to testify about what happened, or if you're the victim, participating as a plaintiff in the case.

            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;">Step - 6: Seeking Victim Support:</b> Throughout the legal process, it's important for victims to seek support and assistance. This could include accessing victim services provided by government agencies or NGOs, seeking counseling to cope with the trauma of the crime, and pursuing restitution for any damages or losses suffered.
            
            <br><b style="padding-left:20px ;"></b> By following these steps, individuals can help ensure that justice is served and offenders are held accountable for their actions under the law.</p>
