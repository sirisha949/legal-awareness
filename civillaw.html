        <p><b>Civil Laws:</b>
            Civil laws encompass a broad spectrum of legal rules and regulations that govern interactions and disputes between individuals, organizations, or entities in non-criminal matters. These laws primarily deal with private rights and obligations, contracts, property ownership, family relationships, inheritance, and torts (civil wrongs causing harm or loss). Unlike criminal laws, civil laws do not involve government prosecution but rather seek to resolve conflicts and provide remedies to injured parties.
